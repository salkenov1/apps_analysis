    "**In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.**\n",

    "We concluded that the Games genre is the most profitable genre at this time. Moreover, taking a popular book (fiction) and turning it into an app (most likely a game) would be a profitable engagement. Nevertheless, Games is the most frequent genre in AppStore, new features must take a place in this game. For example, the implementation of the Games of Thrones world with all elements from the books might possibly be sucessful."
